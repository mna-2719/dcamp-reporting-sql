# Reporting in SQL

In this course, you applied all the SQL concepts and functions I've learned so far to build out my very own dashboard. By navigating through an Olympics database, I became an expert data explorer and learned how to understand novel database quickly and effectively. Since data is never perfect, I gained valuable strategies to deal with real-world issues commonly found with SQL, including how to remove data duplication and how to turn messy data into clean, organized reports. Lastly, I conquered complex calculations using window functions and layered calculations, all within the same report. This was a perfect class for anyone who will be commonly pulling data from databases and is a great complement for those who use R or Python for data science.
